            I want to take the question aspect of Archive and bring that to life.
            <br>
            <br>
            My idea is to code a multi-choice questionnaire, that users interact with. The idea is that the answers have 'hidden' attributes connected to them, and when an answer is selected, the 'hidden attribute' is then slotted into an end-screen card which displays information about the user.
            <br>
            To keep this realistic and within a reasonable skill range, I want to focus on solely multi-choice questions, and then have a final card at the end which features the basics. Name, Age, Likes, Dislikes, Fears. Features like the generated advertisements will be too difficult to do.
            <br>
            Creating a full-screen PC application which is accessed by individuals. Upon further consideration, I would like this project to be more gallery-based, a small group of individuals who have an interest in what they are doing. I feel that would work best.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two ways to approach this:
            <br>
            <br>
            1) I would need to brush up on OOP JavaScript. This option allows for maximum creativity and customisation, but I am not very good at JavaScript, I would need to find multiple tutorials.
            <br>
            <br>
            2) Use a third-party quiz builder, this option is much easier and more efficient but also might not have much room for customisation.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would like to try a search for JavaScript tutorials first, but if I cannot find anything I will resort to option two.

            Upon further thinking, I had decided to develop two interactive aspects of Archive. These are the 'quiz' aspect and the database. This way, I can show visually what I am aiming for. Producing assets that users can interact with.
            <br>
            <br>
            Quiz:
            <br>
            <br>
            After much research, I found that I simply did not have the coding knowledge necessary in order to code a fully functional quiz application. I instead opted to use Adobe XD, to produce a prototype instead. The idea is that it serves as a visual representation of how the set-up and user flow would function.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is a screen-recording of it in action:
            <br>
            <video class ="videoWrap" controls>
                <source src="content/quizScreenRecord.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <br>

            Here, I demonstrate how a user may navigate and decide their answers. Whilst these are not definitive final questions, they serve as a representation of the sudden privacy invasion I want my application to invoke. The questions start off seemly harmless and simple, but as the user progresses, they become much more personal.
            <br>
            <br>
            I may add a final 'card' that comes up with a perceived identity at the end, although that is dependant on time and if I deem it truly necessary.

            I have set out to code a database, in my concept I wanted an interactive database of all the users and their information. For privacy reasons, I have opted to code pre-set false personas, as opposed to creating an option to create new cards. But this feature may be added provided the right coding knowledge is found.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a snippet of what a database could look like. I created a carousel, which is essentially a slideshow. Using the Flickity plugin, I was able to create a fully interactive slideshow. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is a screen-recording of what I have produced:
            <br>

            <video class ="videoWrap" controls>
                <source src="content/codingScreenRecord.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <br>
            <br>
            Here is the link to the Flickity asset I used, this made the process much easier:

            <p class="blogDetails">These are the final products I produced. 
            <br>
            For my Quiz Prototype, I added in an additional feature that brought the user to an eternal loading screen once they completed the quiz. This helped slow the roll of the interactions so it didn't end so abruptly.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
            With my Database Prototype, I had attempted to add in a feature that allowed users to create their own personal cards. But the code was beyond my skill level. I managed to code the form but I couldn't get to a point where it created objects from the input, so I scrapped the idea.

            <br> 
            The Database is purely visual and just serves as a representation of how the information will be displayed.
